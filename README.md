This is a dynamic Power BI dashboard designed to track key metrics—Sales, Profit, and Quantity—across four regions: Central, East, South, and West. The dashboard provides users with an interactive experience to filter and compare data based on the selected year, while dynamically switching between the three metrics.

Features:
Regional Metrics: Display Sales, Profit, and Quantity for each region (Central, East, South, West) based on the selected year.

Dynamic selection between Sales, Profit, and Quantity.
Comparison of Sales with the previous year (PY) for the selected year.
Bar sparklines to visualize monthly trends for each region, including an average line for better analysis.
Sales by State:

Bubble Map: Visualizes sales distribution across different states, with bubble sizes corresponding to sales volume, allowing quick identification of high or low sales areas.
Bar Chart: A bar chart complements the bubble map, breaking down sales by state and allowing for easy comparisons between states.
Key Metrics Table/Grid: Displays a table with key metrics for both current and previous years (CY and PY):

CY Sales, PY Sales, and YoY Sales Growth.
CY Profit, PY Profit, and YoY Profit Growth.
CY Quantity, PY Quantity, and YoY Quantity Growth.
